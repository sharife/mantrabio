      Terry is in charge of building Mantra Bio’s internal technological
      capabilities to engineer and evaluate exosomes as a therapeutic modality.
      Through his career, he has consistently worked at the intersection of
      instrumentation and biology with the overarching goal of enabling and
      increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of biology research. In past
      experience, as design lead, Terry brought multiple products to market
      which went on to win innovation awards including *R&D 100*, *The Scientist
      New Product Award*, and the *Lab Automation New Product Award*. He holds a
      B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering (and a minor in Music) from
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he studied the field of
      magnetic resonance imaging to visualize complex tissue architecture.
      Outside of work Terry can be found sailing, hiking, or playing chamber
      music with his friends (an event his his two year old son calls
      “hoedowns”).
