    Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest
    understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown
    commercially under other trees that provided shade. The
    forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for
    a great number of migratory and resident species.

    Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known
    geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
    specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
    the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
    degree available.
