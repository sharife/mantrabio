intro:
  description: >-
    All cells, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, release extracellular vesicles and
    exosomes as part of their normal physiology and during acquired
    abnormalities. Depending on the cell of origin, exosomes can contain many
    cell constituents, including DNA, RNA, lipids, metabolites, and cell-surface
    proteins. Exosomes have been shown to drive inter-cellular communication by
    binding to specific tissues and deploying their contents, thereby altering
    biological function.


    Mantra Bio is harnessing the natural exosome pathway to generate engineered
    Targeted Exosome Vehicles (TEVs) through our REVEAL™ Platform.

    At the heart of REVEAL™ lies a powerful dry lab-to-wet lab interface that
    drives the discovery of first-in-class medicines at unprecedented speeds. By
    leveraging rational design and cutting-edge technology in computation,
    robotics, and bioengineering, Mantra Bio is building next-generation
    therapies that can solve some of the most intractable diseases.
