    All cells release extracellular vesicles and exosomes as part of their
    normal physiology and during acquired abnormalities. Depending on the cell
    of origin, exosomes can contain many cell constituents, including DNA, RNA,
    lipids, metabolites, and cell-surface proteins. Exosomes have been shown to
    drive inter-cellular communication by binding to specific tissues and
    deploying their contents, thereby altering biological function.


    Mantra Bio is harnessing the natural exosome pathway to generate engineered
    Targeted Exosome Vehicles (TEVs) through our REVEAL™ Platform.

    At the heart of REVEAL™ lies a powerful dry lab-to-wet lab interface that
    drives the discovery of first-in-class medicines at unprecedented speeds. By
    leveraging rational design and cutting-edge technology in computation,
    robotics, and bioengineering, Mantra Bio is building next-generation
    therapies that can solve some of the most intractable diseases.

    A key pillar at Mantra Bio is the development of a robust, scalable
    bioprocess capable of meeting the rigorous standards of product quality and
    quantity necessary for the clinic. From the company’s inception, we have
    invested significant resources to bring together novel and traditional
    biologics manufacturing technologies to produce exosomes reproducibly, at a
    high purity. Our manufacturing process is scale-up compatible up to 2,000L.


    We take pride in developing state-of-the-art exosome characterization
    technologies to deepen our understanding of our exosome products and to
    ensure safety and potency of every formulation.
