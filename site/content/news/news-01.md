description: Mantra Bio joins the Illumina Accelerator. Mantra is working on
  exosome biology. Exosomes are vesicles released by all cells and found in
  almost all body fluids. They were commonly viewed as acting like garbage
  containers for cells, but recently they have been found to be involved in
  communication and delivery functions in the cells. Other companies working on
  this included Codiak Biosciences, EvOx Therapeutics, ReNeuron and Capricor.
