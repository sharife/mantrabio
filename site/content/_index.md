    Exosomes are powerful nano-messengers that comprise nature’s broad cellular
    communication network. Through highly targeted mechanisms, exosomes bind to
    specific tissues and deploy their contents, thereby altering biological
    function. Ongoing scientific discovery of the exosome network has birthed a
    transformative class of biologics that are targeted to specific tissues and
    cells to deliver a variety of therapeutic payloads. Importantly, exosome
    therapies have been shown to be safe in human trials.
intro:
  heading: Exosome drug discovery powered by REVEAL
  text: >-
    Mantra Bio is the creator of REVEAL, an exosome engineering platform
    combining computational biology, lab automation, and screening to generate
    targeted exosome vehicles (TEVs) for a broad set of therapeutic areas.

      Novel targets are identified through data science and machine-learning of
      Mantra’s deep, proprietary database of human exosome-to-cell-to-tissue
      OMICs data.

    text: >-
      Best-in-class exosome engineering methods display targeting motifs on the
      exosome surface to achieve tissue specificity and load TEVs with proteins,
      nucleic acids, and small molecules for delivery.
  - heading: Automated screening in living systems

      TEV candidates are rapidly screened through cell-based assays and in vivo
      animal models to measure selectivity and potency.

    At the heart of REVEAL lies a powerful dry lab-to-wet lab interface that
    drives the discovery of best-in-class medicines at unprecedented speeds. By
    leveraging rational design and cutting-edge technology in computation,
    robotics, and bioengineering, Mantra Bio is building next-generation
    therapies that can solve some of the most intractable diseases.
