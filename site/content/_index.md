    Exosomes are powerful nano-messengers that comprise nature’s cellular
    communication network. Through highly targeted mechanisms, exosomes bind to
    specific cells and tissues to deploy their contents, influencing biological
    function. After decades of scientific discovery, exosomes are being
    harnessed to form a transformative class of biologics, exosome therapeutics,
    enabling unprecedented targeted delivery of therapeutic payloads.
intro:
  heading: Exosome therapeutics powered by REVEAL
  text: >-
    Mantra Bio is the creator of REVEAL, an exosome engineering platform
    combining computational biology and lab automation to generate targeted
    exosome vehicles (TEVs) for a broad set of therapeutic areas.

      Novel targets are identified through data science and machine-learning
      using Mantra Bio's proprietary database of human exosome-to-cell-to-tissue
      OMICs data.

    text: >-
      Best-in-class exosome engineering methods display targeting proteins on
      the exosome surface to achieve tissue specificity and load TEVs with
      therapeutic payloads such as proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules
      for potent delivery.

    text: >-
      TEV candidates are rapidly screened through cell-based assays and in vivo
      animal models to measure selectivity and efficacy.
