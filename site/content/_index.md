  text: Exosomes are powerful nano-messengers that comprise nature’s cellular
    communication network. Our vision at Mantra Bio is that exosomes have
    tremendous potential to become a significant, next-generation therapeutic
    modality when engineered. Using state-of-the-art synthetic biology
    approaches, we can program therapeutic exosome vehicles (TEVs) to engage
    multiple disease pathways simultaneously with the right potency and
    selectivity for each target pathway.

intro:
  heading: Exosome therapeutics powered by REVEAL™
  text: Mantra Bio is the creator of REVEAL™, the world's leading exosome
    engineering platform that combines AI/ML computational biology and synthetic
    biology to rapidly design and develop exosome therapeutics. REVEAL has
    accelerated the development of a diverse pipeline in areas such as
    ophthalmology and infectious diseases.

    text: We identify novel targets using data science and machine-learning with our
      proprietary database of human exosome-to-cell-to-tissue OMICs data.
  - heading: Engineered, Chimeric TEVs
    image: /img/icon-tev.png
    text: We leverage an advanced exosome engineering platform to display
      multi-specific, multi-valent, and multi-modal proteins on the exosome
      surface to target multiple disease pathways simultaneously.
  - heading: Automated screening in living systems
    image: /img/icon-testing.png
    text: We rapidly screen TEV candidates through cell-based assays and *in vivo*
      animal models to optimize selectivity, potency, and efficacy.
