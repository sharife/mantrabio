    Exosomes are powerful nano-messengers that comprise nature’s cellular
    communication network. After decades of scientific discovery, exosomes are
    being harnessed to form a new class of biologics, exosome
    therapeutics, enabling unprecedented targeted delivery of therapeutic
    agents. Importantly, exosome therapeutics have been shown to be safe in
    many human trials.
intro:
  heading: Exosome therapeutics powered by REVEAL™
  text: >-
    Mantra Bio is the creator of REVEAL™, an exosome engineering platform
    combining computational biology and lab automation to generate targeted
    exosome vehicles (TEVs) for a broad set of therapeutic areas.

    text: >-
      We identify novel targets using data science and machine-learning with our proprietary database of human exosome-to-cell-to-tissue OMICs data.

    text: >-
      We use advanced exosome engineering methods to display targeting proteins on
      the exosome surface for tissue specificity and to load TEVs with
      therapeutic agents such as proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules.
  - heading: Automated screening in living systems

    text: >-
      We rapidly screen TEV candidates through cell-based assays and *in vivo*
      animal models to measure selectivity and efficacy.
